# ♟️ Multiplayer Chess Game using Socket Programming

A real-time multiplayer chess game built with Python using socket programming. The system follows a client-server architecture where the server manages matchmaking, game sessions, and communication between clients. It also supports GUI-based interaction, chat messaging, spectator mode, and full chess logic with rule enforcement.
